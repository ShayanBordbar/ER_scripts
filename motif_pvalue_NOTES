This script allows you to map a motif LLR score to its p-value.

Let's say you want to do this for sample/bcd.wtmx

First, check that the pseudocount indicated in the third field
of the header of the wtmx file is what you want (here, it is set to 1.0)

Second, check that the background distribution of nucleotides is what
you want (this is in the hash array %hsbkg in the script).

Then run:
./motif_pvalue2.pl sample/bcd.wtmx sample/out1

Output goes to file sample/out1/bcd.txt

The "Pvalue" field gives a map of LLR to p-value.
The first column is LLR x 1/$BINCNT, so for instance, when $BINCNT was E4, the 
highest possible LLR for this motif and background is 6.8086.
The second column gives the corresponding p-value, i.e.,
Probability of a randomly sampled string (from background model) having
LLR greater than or equal to 6.8086.

So, for example, if you want the LLR for which p-value is 0.05,
the appropriate row will be 
3502    0.0497718000
That is, the LLR threshold corresponding to a p-value of 0.05 is 0.3502.
